# What is the goal of statistical inference?

{% hint style="info" %}
Why do we do statistical inference? 

1. To draw probabilistic conclusions about what we might expect if we collected the same data again.
2. To draw actionable conclusions from data.
3. To draw more general conclusions from relatively few data or observations.
{% endhint %}

So the answer for the question is **all of the above.**
