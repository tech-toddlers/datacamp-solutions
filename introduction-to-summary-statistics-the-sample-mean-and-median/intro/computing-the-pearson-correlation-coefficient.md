# Computing the Pearson correlation coefficient

Pearson correlation coefficient is also called Pearson r. In this section we will calculate Pearson r using `numpy corrcoef` fucntion. 

```text
def pearson_r(x, y):
    """Compute Pearson correlation coefficient between two arrays."""
    # Compute correlation matrix: corr_mat
    corr_mat = np.corrcoef(x, y)

    # Return entry [0,1]
    return corr_mat[0,1]

# Compute Pearson correlation coefficient for I. versicolor: r
r = pearson_r(versicolor_petal_length, versicolor_petal_width)

# Print the result
print(r)
```
