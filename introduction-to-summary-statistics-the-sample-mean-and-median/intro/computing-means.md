# Computing means

This exercise is pretty easy. We just need to calculate mean of given numpy array. 

**Here is the solution:** 

```text
# Compute the mean: mean_length_vers
mean_length_vers = np.mean(versicolor_petal_length)

# Print the result with some nice formatting
print('I. versicolor:', mean_length_vers, 'cm')
```
